ITEMS DROP ON DEATH (excluding bonded shardblades)

HIGHSTORMS - recharge spheres, damage people outside, deletes dropped items left outside

Races: pretty much none, you pick one, such as Veden, but has no stat effect

Classes: 
    Start as peasant
    Find a shard? -> Shardbearer
    Get a soulcaster? -> Become a soulcaster, eventually changes physically
    Forge a nahel bond? -> Different types of Radiant
    Nothing yet? -> Commoner/Nobleman depending on rank
  

    Lighteyed or Darkeyed. New players start darkeyed, can create
    a lighteyed character at presteige 100
    
    Nahns/Dahns: system of "societal points"
    determine nahn, dahn. Successful trading might increase
    or one can give thiers away to another. Obtaining a shard 
    instantly buffs it.
    (Start at 0 points)

Radiants:
    Need stomrlight, they feed from spheres in the inventory, which each have a stormlight attribute
    A good source of gems could be gemhearts from the plains, but in order to get those you need 
    a bridge, so you have to work together with friends to carry it.

    On becoming a radiant, they become lighteyed.
